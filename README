[ prerequisites for running:   the Processing programming environment - get it here: http://processing.org/download ]

This sketch traces wind movement.
The thinner line usually starting at the top left shows longer-term wind movements, moving in the compass direction that the wind blows in.
The larger line starting at the screen centre is a zoomed in view of the current wind blowing - with the historical data tracing back, as it were.

keys/usage:
relax and watch :) 
otherwise:
shift             - pauses/resumes playback
arrow left/right  - set playback to go backwards or forwards
[ / ]             - to skip backwards/forwards one week in time.
